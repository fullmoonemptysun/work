1. The shell is a command-line interpreter that prints a prompt, waits for you to type a command line, and then performs the command. If the first word of the command line does not correspond to a built-in shell command, then the shell assumes that it is the name of an executable file that it should load and run. So in this case, the shell loads and runs the hello program and then waits for it to terminate. The hello program prints its message to the screen and then terminates. The shell then prints a prompt and waits for the next input command line.

2. Each I/O device is connected to the I/O bus by either a controller or an adapter.The distinction between the two is mainly one of packaging. Controllers are chip sets in the device itself or on the system’s main printed circuit board (often called the motherboard). An adapter is a card that plugs into a slot on the motherboard. Regardless, the purpose of each is to transfer information back and forth between the I/O bus and an I/O device.

3. L1 cache is smalled and faster than L2 and L3 (they are just smaller memory components closer to the cpu) implemented using SRAM technologies.
