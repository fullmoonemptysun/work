All collaborators must be identified and each assignment

turned in must include a collaboration statement:

“I worked alone and only with course materials”

OR

“I collaborated on this assignment with <student in class>, got help from <people other

than collaborators and course staff>, and referred to <citations to sources other than

the class material from this semester>”.
