1. Finite automata have very limited memory
2. can have more symbols than 0,1
3. Design a machine for a language, define the language of a machine, etc.
4. Machine recognizes A, means A is the language of Machine
5. Set of accept states can be 0, but start state can’t be nothing.
6. A machine always recognizes 1 language.
7. A language is **Regular** if some finite automaton recognizes it.
8. States represent something. each of them keep track of what has been seen so far in the input.
9. A* is an infinite language if A consists of elements other than $\epsilon$
10. In the proof for closure, the regular languages can have different symbols, but that would not change anything.
