1. **Hypervisor:** A hypervisor is **a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine**. Every virtual machine has its own operating system and applications.  
    The hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resources  
    such as CPU and memory to individual virtual machines as required.
