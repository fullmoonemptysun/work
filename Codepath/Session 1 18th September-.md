  

## In-build python functions:

1. `range(start (optional, default = 0, stop, step (optional def = 1)`

  

1. `min(array of numbers or char`
2. Sum, Min, and Max will have a complexity of O(n)

  

## List Methods:

1. `lst.append(item)`
2. `list.sort()` : sorts in increasing order by default. (look up reverse to change this) nlogn

  

## String Methods:

1. Split = s.split() splits on whitespace into an array.
2. `s.join(x)` joins array elements with `s` in between.

  

1. `s.strip(char)` strips char from the beginning and the end. default for char is whtiespace.

  

1. Who is interviewers looking for?:
    - ability to break down complex problems and think of a solution
    - Write clean and bugfree code
    - DSA
    - Thought process
