1. Use the UMPIRE strategy

  

## Understand:

1. Generate basic sample input and output
2. Explore more unusual Edge cases
3. Explore tradeoffs (memory, performance, code simplicity)
4. Ask questions get clear up

  

  

## Match The problem:

1. Identify the appropriate data structure or algorithm
2. Consider where you’ve seen a similar problem before

  

## Plan the solution:

1. Describe your overall approach in one or two sentences
2. Write down the steps in English
3. Each step should be simple and clear

  

## Implement the solution:

1. Clear plan should be relatively easy to translate. If it’s hard to translate the plan probably isn’t good enough.
2. Get used to the basic python syntax
3. fast typing
4. Translate plan into code.

  

## Review The Code:

1. Check for errors, edge cases, and opportunities to optimize.

  

## Evaluate:

1. Ensure the solution meets the problm’s requirements and hancles edge cases.
2. Talk through all these steps and then here telling them about how your solution works and is good.

  

1. in cases where compilation is not allowed, we can dry run a test case while communicate

## Technical Notes:

1. Keys of dictionaries are a set collection
2. In Python, multiplying a list by an integer like `n` (`[0] * n`) creates a new list with the original list's elements repeated `n` times. Think of it like saying "give me this list `n` times."
