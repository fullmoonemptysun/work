1. Example for intution: In measuring the dimension length of a manufactured part, it is better to make the random variable a continuous variable on some interval of real numbers.
2. Probability density function: A function used to calculate probabilities and to specify the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.

1. The probablity that X is in the interval a < X < b is determined by the integral of f(x) from a to b

> For a continuous random variable X, a probability density functions is a function f(x) such that:  
>   
> 
> - f(x) ≥ 0
> - $\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}$f(x)dx = 1
> - ==$P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = \int^{b}_{a} f(x)dx$== === area under f(x) from a to b.==

  

1. for any point x in a density function:
    
    P(X = x) = 0. The probabilities are only defined for intervals.
    

  

1. Because of above, there is no need to distinguish between < and ≤. and so:
    
    $P(x_1 < X ≤ x_2) = P(x_1 < X ≤ x_2) = P(x_1 < X < x_2)….$
    

  

## 4.2 Cumulative Distribution Functions:

  

1. The alternative method to describe discrete distribution can also be used for continuous variables (CDF)
    
    ==$F(x) = P(X ≤ x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(u)du$==
    
      
    
2. We can go reverse also, we can get the probability density function can be derived from the cumulative distribution function by differentiating:
    
    $\frac{d}{dx} \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(u)du = f(x)$
    
      
    

## 4.3 Mean and Variance of a Continuous random Variable:

- $Mean = E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx$
- $Variance = \sigma^2 = V(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2f(x)dx - \mu^2$
- $Standard \ deviation = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$

  

## 4.4 Continuous Uniform Distribution:

1. Similar to discrete uniform distribution, where the probabilities are identical for each interval.
2. Probability density function becomes:  
    $f(x) = 1/(b-a)$

  

1. Mean and variance:
    - Mean $= \mu = \frac{a+b}{2}$
    - Variance = $\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

  

1. The CDF is derived by integrating:
    
    $\int_{a}^{x} \frac{1}{b-a}du = \frac{x-a}{b-a}$ for a ≤ x < b
    
      
    
    hence,

## 4.5: Normal Distribution:

1. Also known as Gaussian Distribution
2. A random variable X with probability density function:

1. Important Results:

1. A standard normal random variable is A normal random variable with mean zero and variance one that has its cumulative distribution function tabulated in Appendix Table II.

  

1. Following approximations are useful:

Normal to Binomial:

Here,

and so P(X < somea) becomes P(Z ≤ someb)
