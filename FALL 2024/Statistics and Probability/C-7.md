# Central Limit Theorem

1. A point estimate is a reasonable numerical value of a population parameter
    1. $\bar{x}$ for $\mu$
    2. $s^2$ for $\sigma^2$
    3. $p$ for $\hat{p}$

  

1. All the above parameters have their random variables
    - $\bar{X}$ for mean
    - $S^2$
    - $\hat{P}$

  

1. If we have random variables $X_1, X_2,…..X_n$ are a random sample of size n if:
    
    1. the $X_i$ are independent random variables and
    2. every $X_i$ has the same probability distribution
    
    A statistic is any function of the observations in a random sample
    

  

## CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM

1. X is a random variable with mean, $\mu$, and standard deviation, $\sigma$.
2. $\bar{X}$, the sample mean of a random sample of n: $\frac{x_1 + x_2 + …. + x_n}{n}$ for the same n
3. No matter what distribution X is from (discrete or continous, named or unique), $\bar{X}$ will have the normal pdf with E($\bar{X}$) = $\mu$ and $\sigma_{\bar{X}}$ = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ (called the standard error of the mean)
4. $Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{S.D}$
5. **Underlying distribution of x is.** The Distribution of the sample means will be a normal **PDF (distribution becomes continuous)** distribution.
