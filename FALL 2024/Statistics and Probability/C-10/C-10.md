1. Has two degrees of freedom, u and v
2. Needed for 2-s Variance hypo testing
3. MUST PROGRAM INVF before test
4. Fun identity fact:
    1. $f_{\alpha, u , v} = \frac{1}{f_{1-\alpha, v, u}}$
    2. $f_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, u , v} = \frac{1}{f_{1- \frac{\alpha}{2}, v, u}}$

Case - 1, only when we have done a 2 side hypo testing of variances and failed to reject the null (Variances might be equal). Say yes to pooled in calculator.
